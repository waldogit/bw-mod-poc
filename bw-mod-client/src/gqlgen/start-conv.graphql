# update using (_.data.conversation.convId)

# yes this proposal would be invalid graphql, but the developer experience would be such a bliss!
# It further leverages the assumption that the mutation and updated query field key are homonymic.
# assuming they also return the same type, then all that is needed to generate the update is a way to map the mutation response 
# to the query input
