mutation startConversation($conversation: ConversationInput) {
  conversation(conversation: $conversation) {
    ...ConversationFragment
  }
}
# update using (_.data.conversation.convId)

# yes this proposal would be invalid graphql, but the developer experience would be such a bliss!
# It further leverages the assumption that the mutation and updated query field key are homonymic.
# assuming they also return the same type, then all that is needed to generate the update is a way to map the mutation response
# to the query input
